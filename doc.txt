                      LProg PIC Programmer Firmware
                            25 December 2022

The LPRG firmware runs on a Microchip PIC 18F2455 in the LProg PIC
programmer.  This programmer is designed for low cost and can only program
the 3.3 volt PICs.


Firwmare versions

  LPRG 1, 13 June 2008

    Clone of EUSB version 20 firmware, which is the controlling firmware
    of a USBProg PIC programmer.  The PIC type was changed from 18F2550 to
    18F2455, the processor clock speed from 48MHz to 16MHz, and the
    firmware ID changed to the ID for a LProg.  Works on USBProg hardware.
    Changes have not been made yet for the different I/O connections of
    the LProg hardware.

  LPRG 2, 22 June 2008

    Modified for the LPRG1 hardware.  Appears to work correctly.

  LPRG 3, 13 July 2008

    Added UART I/O back in, which was removed for version 2.  The slow 16
    MHz clock rate of the PIC doesn't support 115.2 kBaud, so the baud
    rate was lowered to 19.2 kBaud.  The UART I/O connection is only for
    manufacturing test.  It adheres to the PICPRG protocol except for the
    baud rate.

  LPRG 4, 13 July 2008

    Updated to LPRG2 board.  The only difference is that the LED output
    line is positive logic instead of the negative logic on the LPRG1
    board.  Added switch for enabling or disabling UART I/O.  UART I/O is
    used for production testing.  The UART must be disabled for normal end
    use to prevent the UART receive line from floating.

    Production test version with UART I/O enabled.

  LPRG 5, 13 July 2008

    End user version with UART I/O disabled.  Otherwise identical to LPRG
    4.

  LPRG 6, 13 Aug 2008

    Added TESTGET and TESTSET commands so that serial communication and
    normal operating mode are built into the same firmware.  The HEX file
    sets the test mode to 255, which is normal operating mode.  In that
    case, both the TX and RX lines are outputs held low and do not
    function for serial communication.  In test mode 0 serial
    communication via the RX and TX lines is active.  In this mode the RX
    pin must be externally driven to prevent it from floating.

  LPRG 7, 16 Aug 2008

    Same as LPRG 6 except this version correctly reports supporting up to
    protocol spec version 29.  LPRG 6 only reported support for version 26
    although it was compatible with version 29.  The TESTGET and TESTSET
    commands were defined in protocol spec version 29.

  LPRG 8, 8 Mar 2009

    Fixed bug in GETCAP 0 table.  This caused the programmer to
    incorrectly report its fixed Vdd level.

  LPRG 9, 12 Nov 2009

    Added support for 24F PIC type.

  LPRG 10 seq 5, 4 Jan 2011

    Added support for 16F182x.

  LPRG 11 seq 8, 19 Oct 2011

    Added support for 24FJ parts.  Fixed problem with 16F182x code.

  LPRG 12 seq 2, 1 Mar 2013

    One-off version that implements a slower 16F182x reset algorithm. This
    was done to make the programmer work with a particular piece of
    hardware that did not provide direct connections to the PIC lines, and
    the extra hardware was interfering.  In this version, a extra 400 ms
    wait is added after power up so that a reset supervisor chip allows
    MCLR to be driven high.  Then a 1 ms pulse on MCRL is done to put the
    processor in reset state ready to have the programming mode signature
    clocked in, regardless of what may have happened to PGC and PGD when
    power was applied.

    This version will function when the programmer is connected to all the
    programming lines normally, but will be slower.  It is not recommended
    for general use.

  LPRG 13 seq 24, 4 Feb 2015

    Added support for 18FxxK80.  Added serial protocol commands EECON1,
    EEADR, EEADRH, and EEDATA.  Updated to new USB subsystem include file
    scheme.

  LPRG 14 seq 1, 6 Feb 2015

    Built with new base files that add reset ID 11, which is for the PIC
    18FxxK80 high voltage program entry mode.  This programmer doesn't
    provide high Vpp voltage, so can't use this mode.  This version is
    therefore functionally equivalent to version 13, but is built with the
    latest base source files.  Uses same base source files as firmware
    EUSB 26.

  LPRG 15 seq 59, 24 Feb 2016

    Updated to protocol spec version 29.7, which adds support for 24/33 EP
    series parts.  This included adding reset ID 12, making addresses of
    various target registers configurable, and implementing the "fast
    tick" mechanism.

    Fast ticks are implemented as instruction cycles.  In this version,
    fast ticks are only used to time the wait after programming 2 words in
    a 24/33 EP series target PIC.

    Changed processor clock frequency from 16 MHz to 24 MHz, which is
    still valid for its 3.3 V power level.  The instruction cycle rate is
    now 6 MHz, was 4 MHz previously.

    IDRESET now causes various configurations to be reset to default.

    Same common code as USBProg firmare EUSB 28.

  LPRG 16 seq 2, 13 May 2018

    Updated to use new version of common PICPRG_F16E.INS.ASPIC library
    file with minor bug fix.

  LPRG 17 seq 2, 26 Mar 2019

    Made build again after update to latest build script conventions, and
    changes to the common PIC programmers firmware modules in the PPROG
    repository.

    Added 16FB module.  This is for the new PICs that use 8 bit
    programming opcodes and 24 bit instruction words.

    Untested.

  LPRG 18 seq 10, 14 Dec 2021

    Added reset ID 13: Vpp low, then "MCHP" signature MSB to LSB order.
    This supports the 16F PICs with 8 bit programming opcodes.

  LPRG 19 seq 1, 17 Dec 2021

    Updated to reset tables bug fixed in common code.

  LPRG 20 seq 8, 14 Sep 2022

    Updated to new USB library code structure, which now requires using
    USB_SETUP.INS.ASPIC.

    Uses new facilities in the USB code to detect and recover from wedged
    USB hardware.  If the USB hardware is found wedged, it is reset, then
    a wait for 1 second performed, then the processor is reset.

    Cleaned up comments in interrupt routine.  Removed mention of hardware
    PWM, which is not used by this firmware.

  LPRG 21 seq 2, 2 Nov 2022

    Added read ID 9 and write ID 15.  These support PIC 18 with 8 bit
    programming commands.

  LPRG 22

    Removed support for LPRG1 board.  Removed hard-coded debug switches.
    Debug switches are now set with the DEBUG environment variable.
